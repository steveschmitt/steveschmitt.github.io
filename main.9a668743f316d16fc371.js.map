Except as provided herein, any dispute arising out of, or in connection with, the Terms will be determined only by binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, in accordance with the commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Arbitrable disputes include, without limitation, disputes about the formation, interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms. Any dispute arising under the Terms will be brought within two (2) years of when the claim accrued.

The parties will not be permitted to bring, or participate in, and the arbitrator will not have any authority or jurisdiction to hear or decide, any claims brought as any type of purported class action, coordinated action, aggregated action, or similar action or proceeding. Each party must only bring claims against each other in their individual capacity. In the event any of the terms or provisions of these Terms shall be held to be unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions shall be unimpaired and the enforceable term or provision shall be replaced by such enforceable term or provision as comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable term or provision.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h2>Changes to the Site; Termination</h2>\r\n      <p>SurePayroll reserves the right to change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site, and those products and services available at the site, including but not limited to revising and/or deleting features or other information without prior notice.
